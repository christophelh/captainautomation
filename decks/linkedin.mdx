## How to make a great impact when people find your profile.

As Richard Branson says, you need to find your perfect pitch.

1. Create a Twitter-friendly headline. (Less than 140 characters)
2. Donâ€™t tell people where you are now, but instead tell them who you can become
3. Use simple words, even your grandma needs to understand it
